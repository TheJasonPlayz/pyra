- The code is counting the number of ways to make change for N cents, where N is a value and coins are an array of values.
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply
of each of S = {S1, S2, .., Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

// - Then we declare a Scanner object called input which will read user input from keyboard.
